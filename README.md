# eote-dice-roller

This is a dice roller for use in Google Hangouts for those playing Edge of the Empire or related Fantasy Flight Star Wars games.

*Note that this application has no official connection whatsoever with Fantasy Flight Publishing, Inc. or Lucasfilm, Ltd. It is purely a fan creation intended as a tool for a popular role-playing game and is offered free of charge.*

To use the roller, visit https://cjhooker.github.io/eote-dice-roller-release/hangout-button.html and click on the button to launch the roller in a hangout.

There is a QA version as well, which may have more features, but may also be less stable. It can be launched from https://cjhooker.github.io/eote-dice-roller-qa/hangout-button.html.

If you are interested in working with the source code and perhaps contributing to the project, more instructions will be coming here soon.
